<p> On Nov. 21, 16 days after Election Day, Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey ceded the election to Republican opponent Dave McCormick. Originally elected in 2006, Casey served in the United States Congress for 18 years. McCormick served as Under-Secretary of Treasury and as Deputy National Security Advisor under President Bush and more recently served as the chief executive officer of one of the world's largest hedge funds from 2020 to 2022. 
 </p>

<p> Prior to election day, <a href="https://www.270towin.com/2024-senate-polls/pennsylvania">polls conducted</a> by the New York Times, Fox News, Muhlenberg college and more predicted Casey as the winner of the upcoming race. For days following election day, most publications considered the race still uncallable. With a final margin of around 16,000 votes, McCormick successfully flipped the seat.

<div class="caption"> 
Many polls prior to the election inaccurately predicted Casey as the winner of the upcoming election. 
</div>

<p> In the wake of Casey's loss, especially considering the general polling inaccuracy, critical questions emerge: Was this election representative of the national retreat back towards Republican politics? Were the results affected by Democratic fatigue with long-standing party leaders? Or, could it have been the unprecedented amount of money poured into this election by political action committees (PACs)? 

<p> This election consisted of over $237,000,000 in monetary campaign endorsements from <a href="https://www.fec.gov/press/resources-journalists/political-action-committees-pacs/">PACs </a>. PACs are formed over years by powerful allies to political parties, who are able to make larger scale donations to campaign efforts that are prohibited by individuals.
 </p>

<p> In this election specifically, according to data recorded by the Federal Election Commission, the largest sum of money funneled into this election was strategically targeted as money to oppose Casey. The reasoning behind this? Well, FEC laws around PAC spending make it easier to pledge opposition money. 
</p>

<p> “Because of the way that Super PAC and PAC spending is, and the laws around it, it just tends to be a little bit easier, because you aren’t supposed to be cooperating with the campaigns,” said Mark Brockway, political scientist and professor of Campaign Analysis at Syracuse University.  </p>

Out of all of the classifications of PAC expenditures, the most amount of money poured in was labeled as funds to oppose Casey.

<p> On Sept. 12, <a href="https://pennsylvaniaindependent.com/politics/republicans-senate-2024-election-bob-casey-dave-mccormick-mitch-mcconnell-campaign-ads-covid-relief-votes/"> The Pennsylvania Independent </a> reported that a PAC closely related to Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell–the Senate Leadership Fund–was spending millions of dollars to smear Casey over his support of President Joe Biden’s 2021 COVID-19 relief checks. The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bob+casey+boston+marathon+bomber&oq=bob+casey+boston+marathon+bomber&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCDgwNjJqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:98b1abbf,vid:1pe9T3zVid8,st:0"> campaign claimed</a> that Casey allegedly voted yes to sending a relief check to one of the individuals convicted in the Boston Marathon boming back in 2013.  
 </p>

 <p> On Sept. 4, around a week before the advertisement aired, the Senate Leadership Fund made an almost $4,000,000 donation labeled as "TV/Media Placement."

<p> But aside from the large dollar amount donations being made regularly by PACs, the Casey and McCormick campaigns both consistently reached out to their voting base and asked for donations from them as well. Per FEC regulations, individuals can make up to a $3,300 donation to federal candidates per election, referred to as non-independent expenditures. These donations can be used directly by campaigns, unlike PAC donations. But these donations also represent more than just the money–they signify a vote, too. 
 </p>

<p> “A donation isn’t just a donation,” said Brockway. “It links the voter, the individual, to the campaign. And as we saw with Bernie Sanders in 2016, there does seem to be some political purchase off selling the fact that you’re getting a lot of support from individual donors.” 

 </p>

<p> On Dec. 10, Casey stated in a press conference that the result of this election would not necessarily signify his retirement from politics. Whether the results of the election were directly impacted by the amount of money spent is unknown but the implications of campaign financing practices—independent and non-independent—on electoral results remains a critical question.
